QuickBART

(Quick BART Android Routing Tool)
QuickBART was created to provide a quick way to access the current BART train
information. The apps that I have found require several clicks in to get to
actually showing the desired route's times for right now.

Application allows for creating favorite routes (from one station to another)
which are then access from the main menu. Tapping on a favorite displays the
next four train routes leaving the departure stations with the departure time
and arrival time at the destination station. Clicking on one of the routes
will display the details for that route including the fare and if transfers
are required.
